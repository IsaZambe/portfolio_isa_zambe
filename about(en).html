                <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Hi, I'm Isabela! I'm a Virgo, coffee lover <em>(but who isn't right?)</em> and Frederico's mother, the menace black cat that is my reason to live! I was born in Vitória, Espírito Santo, but I grew up in Guarapari, where I had the most perfect childhood: beach and adventures in a farm. I have two amazing sisters: an civil engineer and a programmer.<br> <br>I graduated in Pharmacy and worked in the area for 2 years until I've decided to move to Canada. I spent five years in Toronto, where I graduated in Biotechnology hoping I could work in pharmaceutical research projects... <em>spoiler: didn't happen!</em> I ended up working as a pharmacy assistant, but working with the public is not for everybody, I started to go crazy. After I spiraled down, I kept asking myself: <em><strong class="destaque">"Dear Lord, what am I supposed to do with my life?!" </strong></em><br> <br> After talking over with my sisters and friends, I decided I wanted something that would allow me to work from home, make my own money without the toxic environment that is working with the public. That's when I chose to embark in this journey that is front-end programming! Surprisingly, I ended up loving the area. Besides that, I am a certified English to Brazilian Portuguese translator specialized in editorial translation<em> (gotta read them all!).</em> In the future, I want to get deeper in tech, specializing in UI/UX design and see if I can actually find my self somewhere in the field. <br> <br> Looks like a long path, doesn't it? But time is passing anyways, so I might as well make the most of it, be the best I can be and enjoy life to the fullest. <strong class="destaque">This is my portfolio, c'mon in! Just don't mind the mess! </strong>&#128516;</p>
